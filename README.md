# QMachine

## Introduction

Welcome to QMachine, a comprehensive collection of tools designed for developers venturing into the world of machine learning.

This project includes a variety of functionalities such as activation functions, loss functions, technical analysis indicators, and other useful tools tailored to assist in the exploration and implementation of machine learning techniques in quantitative finance.

## Features

- **Activation Functions**: Implementations of various activation functions like Sigmoid, ReLU, and Tanh, essential for building neural networks.
- **Loss Functions**: A set of loss functions including MSE (Mean Squared Error), Cross-Entropy, and others, enabling effective model training and evaluation.
- **Technical Analysis Indicators**: Tools for technical analysis in finance, including moving averages, RSI (Relative Strength Index), and Bollinger Bands.
- Additional utilities and tools relevant to quant developers interested in machine learning.

## Getting Started

### Installation
